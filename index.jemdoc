== About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in ECE department at UCLA working under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MCClSvsAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Alyson Fletcher] and [https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/ Prof. Sundeep Rangan]. I received my Masterâ€™s degree at UCLA in 2018, and my Bachelor's degree at University of Tehran in 2016, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.



== Research Interests
My research is focused on theoretical machine learning with the broad goal of understanding the asymptotic of learning in deep neural networks. I apply tools from high-dimensional statistics and large-scale optimization to provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for learning and generalization in machine learning problems. I am also interested in high-dimensional time series models with applications to computational neuroscience such as modeling complex neural sensory responses in the brain.
